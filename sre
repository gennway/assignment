Scenario: Load Balancer Failure

Destroy the load balancing services and check if traffic is 
correctly distributed among healthy instances.

Scenario: Disk Failure Resilience

Simulate a disk failure on a GCE instance by corrupting or deleting disk. Verify if the system gracefully handles the failure, switches to backup disks or snapshots, and restores functionality without data loss.

Scenario: High Availability Zone Failure

Example: Simulate a failure in a GCE availability zone where instances are deployed. Check if instances automatically failover to healthy zones or if manually configured redundancy mechanisms work as expected.



GKE

Scenario: Node Draining

Example: Initiate a node drain operation in GKE, simulating maintenance or decommissioning. Verify if Kubernetes gracefully terminates pods running on the draining node and reschedules them onto healthy nodes to maintain service availability.



Scenario: Resource Exhaustion

Example: Create or deploy workloads that consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) within pods. Validate if Kubernetes evicts or throttles such pods based on resource limits and ensures the stability of other workloads in the cluster.   + VPA


Scenario: Multiple Node Failures

Example: Simulate concurrent failures of multiple nodes within a GKE cluster. Validate if Kubernetes reschedules affected pods across available healthy nodes while maintaining the desired replica count and service availability.

Scenario: High Availability Validation

Example: Introduce simulated hardware failures and observe how GCE maintains high availability by automatically restarting instances or migrating them to healthy hardware.


Scenario: Backup and Restore Validation

Example: Test backup and restoration procedures for GCE instances to confirm data recovery processes in case of instance failure or data loss.


Scenario: Subnet or Zone Failure

Example: Introduce failures in specific subnets or zones and validate the GCP setup's ability to reroute traffic and maintain service availability.

Scenario: Load Balancer Failover

Example: Simulate a load balancer failure or disruption and validate if traffic is rerouted seamlessly to backup or redundant load balancers without affecting service availability.


Scenario: Burst Load Handling

Example: Simulate burst loads and sudden spikes in traffic to evaluate how GCP's autoscaling and load balancing mechanisms handle rapid changes in demand without performance degradation.
